Q1. Create an Interface called Animals with speak(), eat() methods. Create two classes Cat and Dog implementing their own versions of these methods.
program
	package animal1;

public interface Animal1 {

    public void eat();
    public void speak();
       
    }

	
package animal1;

public class Cat implements Animal1{
    public void eat(){
        System.out.println("cat eats meat" );
        
    }
    public void speak(){
        System.out.println("cat speak miu miu");
    }
    public static void main(String args[]){
        Cat cat=new Cat();
        cat.eat();
        cat.speak();
    }
    
    
}


package animal1;

public class Dog implements Animal1{
    public void eat(){
        System.out.print("dog eats meat" );
        
    }
    public void speak(){
        System.out.println("dogs can bark");
    }
    public static void main(String args[]){
        Dog dog=new Dog();
        dog.eat();
        dog.speak();
    }
    
}

Q2.Create an Abstract Class Animals with color, breed and name as variables, along with eat() abstract method and also a speak() method which is not abstract.
program   
         




Q3.Take two numbers as string input and convert them into Integers and find the maximum of the two numbers.
program  
       package string1;

public class Temp {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
        int b = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);
        if(a>b){
        
        
        System.out.println("greater number is a"+a);
        }
        else{
            System.out.println( " greater number is b"+b);
        }
            }
    
}
